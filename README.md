Number of monitoring tools are available for the modern datacenters. We made an effort to seamlessly integrate the legacy data center with modern approach of monitoring.
The project has the following important components:
  1. clint stub to collect data and push towards server
  2. Load balancer, which acts as allowing multiple server to register and sharing the available traffic distribution
  3. Cloud hosted Web-service to monitor the datacenter
